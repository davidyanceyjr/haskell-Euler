--Using euler-project-22_names.txt ..
--a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
--begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.

--Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
--multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

--For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
--COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
--So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

--What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

-- Begin by using splitOn to create a list from the contents of the file.
-- When read using readFile "contents" evaluates to a list with one long
-- element of strings.
--
-- Next, we sort the list created from contents. I clean the contents stripping
-- the non-alpha characters from the list. genScore uses the alphaValue to
-- generate a score from each word.
--
-- Finally, the totalScore is calculated using the product of the index with the
-- value.
